# School Work and Projects
In this reposititory, I'll be sharing my code samples.

My recent code samples will begin with the prefix of 'p'. Some of my school projects that I still have are the XML and JavaScript ones.

My other projects I have recently started consist of practicing my front-end skills. Some of these are still work in progress and my first one is the Tesla front page clone.
