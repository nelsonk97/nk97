# Nelson's school work & projects
Welcome to my repo! If you found yourself here, I must have applied to your company recently and you're aware I am a recent graduate and I have internship experience. My skills I am comfortable with are as follows:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- MySQL
- Visual Studio Code
- Node.js
- React.js
- Command line
- cPanel
- Microsoft Azure
- Amazon Web Services
- LAMP stack
- JIRA
- Harvest
- Zeppelin
- Agile methodologies
- Mac, Windows, and Linux
- Adobe software suite
- Virtual machines

Being taught primarily as a back-end developer, I have been making substanstial strides into becoming a well-rounded full stack developer. I have been putting more effort into learning front-end technologies such as React, and I have no signs of stopping!

Since I graduated in April 2020, despite there having been setbacks, I never stopped learning. I firmly believe in continuing to learn even when you're done school. In our industry, it's always evolving. And that's what makes it fun.

If you have the chance to, please review the source code for website-2021. It is probably one of my most proud projects. I designed it from scratch, used a completely new framework, and utilized cPanel.

Thank you for viewing, and stay tuned for more unique projects.
