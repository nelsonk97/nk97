# School Work and Projects
In this reposititory, I'll be sharing my work from throughout the duration of my time at Fanshawe College while enrolled in Internet Applications & Web Development (IWD1).

Unfortunately, during the second half of 2019, my Mac had failed and my backups were corrupted. Everything from my first year in my program had been lost.

Work in this repo will be my most recently completed projects and exemplars.
