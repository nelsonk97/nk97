# Nelson's school work & projects
Welcome to my repo! If you found yourself here, I must have applied to your company recently and you're aware I am a recent graduate and I have internship experience. My skills I am comfortable with are as follows:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- MySQL
- Visual Studio Code
- Node.js
- React.js
- Command line
- cPanel
- Microsoft Azure
- Amazon Web Services
- LAMP stack
- JIRA
- Harvest
- Zeppelin
- Agile methodologies
- Mac, Windows, and Linux
- Adobe software suite
- Virtual machines

Being taught primarily as a back-end developer, I have been making substanstial strides into becoming a well-rounded full stack developer. I have been putting more effort into learning front-end technologies such as React, and I have no signs of stopping!
